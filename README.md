# The Doppler Effect

This project is a simple simulation that exaggerates how a star changes colour as it moves toward and away from an observer.

When an object moves away from us, the light is shifted to the red end of the spectrum, as its wavelengths get longer. If an object moves closer, the light moves to the blue end of the spectrum, as its wavelengths get shorter. - See more at: [space.com](http://www.space.com/25732-redshift-blueshift.html#sthash.QoGW1tRx.dpuf)
